        <h2>NATIONAL MISSION FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE (NMSA)</h2>
        <h3>Rainfall Area Development:</h3>
        <p>For the purpose of achieving sustainability in dryland agriculture, the integrated farming system is promoted. Instead of depending on a single crop alone for farm income, the cropping system approach is promoted. In our district, the most suitable cropping system is pulses followed by cotton. A farmer can avail assistance for an extent of 1 Ha only under this scheme. Every farmer can purchase a milch animal and he is eligible for a back ended subsidy of Rs.17,500 per animal. The assistance for the cropping system is 50% limited to Rs.10000/Ha. So a beneficiary can avail a maximum assistance of Rs.27500. Permanent Vermicompost structures can be constructed in the farmers’ yard at 50% subsidy limited to Rs.25000/Unit and temporary structures at 50% subsidy limited to Rs.6000/unit. This scheme will be implemented at a total outlay of Rs.266.75L during 2017-18</p>
        <h2>NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY MISSION (NFSM)</h2>
        <p>To achieve food security, this scheme aims at improving the production of food grains either by increasing the area cultivated or by increasing the crop productivity. In our District, NFSM is implemented in two crop groups namely coarse cereals (Cumbu, maize and minor millets) and pulses (blackgram and greengram). A beneficiary can avail benefit for a maximum extent of 2 Ha under this scheme.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Under NFSM – </b>Coarse cereals, the hybrid seeds are distributed at 50% subsidy and demonstrations on improved technologies are conducted at Rs.5000/Ha. The total outlay for this year is Rs.77 L.
            <li><b>Under NFSM – </b>Pulses, the assistance is provided for production and distribution of HYV seeds at Rs.2500/Qtl, demonstratons on improved technologies at Rs.5000/Ha, cropping system based demonstration at Rs.10000/Ha, bund cropping with redgram at Rs.100/Ha, distribution of liquid biofertilizer at Rs.150/Ha, PP Chemicals and MN mixture at Rs.500/Ha, power sprayer at Rs.3000/No., rotavator at Rs.35000/No., sprinkler at Rs.10000/Ha, HDPE pipes at Rs.50/m limited to Rs.15000/Ha and PVC pipes at Rs.35/m limited to Rs.15000/Ha. The total outlay for this year is 387.6 L.</li>
        </li>
        <h3>NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (NADP)</h3>
        <p>To improve the production and productivity of crops, NADP is implemented specific to each major crop classes like paddy, millets, pulses and oilseeds. Under NADP, a farmer can avail benefit for a maximum extent of 2 Ha.
NADP Paddy Mission includes components like distribution of biofertilizers, Zinc Sulphate, Weedicide and Micro nutrients at 50% subsidy and power tiller at 50% subsidy limited to Rs.75000/unit. The sanctioned amount is Rs.27.67 L
NADP Millet Mission covers distribution of MN Mixture and bio-fertilizers at 50% subsidy at a total outlay of Rs.23.8 lakhs.
Under NADP – Pulses mission, assistance is provided for quality seed production at Rs.2500/Qtl, seed treatment chemical at Rs.100/Ha, Line sowing at Rs.1000/Ha and 2% DAP foliar spray at Rs.650/Ha. The amount sanctioned is Rs.174.15 L.
The Oilseed Mission comprises of production and distribution of certified seeds, distribution of liquid bio-fertilizers and bund cropping with castor.
Enrichment of soil fertility is another intervention under NADP which aims at improving the soil fertility by cultivating green manure crop which is ploughed in situ at the flowering stage. Under this scheme, the seeds of GM crops are distributed at 50% subsidy. This scheme will be implemented in 297 Ha at Rs.1500/Ha.</p>
        <h2>Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative (SSI):</h2>
        <p>To make sugarcane cultivation profitable and to promote improved technologies among farmers, SSI is implemented. The farmers are provided with single budded chip seedlings at 15000 No./Ha at 50% subsidy . Under this scheme, the farmers registered with sugar mills alone can avail the benefit. These farmers are provided with drip irrigation utilizing the assistance available under Micro Irrigation component of PMKSY.</p>
        <h2>MICRO IRRIGATION (MI): PER DROP MORE CROP COMPONENT OF PMKSY</h2>
        <p>The objective is economical and efficient usage of water in order to increase the area irrigated per drop of available water and thereby to increase the crop production. More focus is given on promotion of MI for water intensive crops so as to minimise the water requirement. The subsidy payable to the beneficiary is limited to the unit costs specified in the scheme guidelines. Only BIS marked systems / components can be supplied under the scheme. The Aadhar detail of the beneficiary is mandatory. In Tamil Nadu, the Small and Marginal Farmers are eligible for 100% subsidy and others for 75% subsidy under this scheme. The target under MI for 2017-18 is 220Ha for Drip Irrigation and 410Ha for Sprinkler Irrigation at a total outlay of Rs.208.9L.</p>
        <p>The Block Assistant Directors of Agriculture, Agricultural Officer,/ Deputy Agriculture Officer or Assistant Agriculture Officer may be contacted in connection with the above schemes.</p>
        <h2>Objectives of Mission Soil Health Card Scheme</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To issue soil health card every 2 years, to all the farmers of the country, so as to provide a basis to address nutrient deficiencies in fertilization practices</li>
            <li>To diagnose soil fertility related constrains with standardized procedures for sampling uniformly across states and analysis and design taluqa/block level fertilizer recommendations in targeted districts</li>
            <li>To develop and promote soil test based nutrient management in the districts for enhancing nutrient use efficiency</li>
            <li>The quality of Soil Testing and fertilizer recommendation depends upon soil sampling. For this following scientific norms are prescribed in Tamil Nadu. In the wholly irrigated areas, samples are drawn in a grid of 2.5 ha. In Rainfed areas sampling is done in 10 ha grid. GPS co ordinates are also essentially recorded at the time of soil sampling. In addition basic particulars are collected from the farmers of the grid are also collected so as to give Soil Health cards to all the farmers</li>
