          <h3>Thiruchendur Murugan Temple</h3>
          <p><u><b>Story Behind the Temple</b></u></p>
          <p>Surapadman, the demon king, reigned over Veera Mahendrapuri, an island fortress. Lord Shiva granted him many boons as the Lord was impressed by Surapadman’s immense devotion and loyalty. Surapadman became more and more powerful with time, and with the immortality he possessed, it wasn’t much longer for his arrogance to take over. He rebelled and successfully captured all the three worlds—Heaven, earth, and hell. He made the Devas, the heavenly immortals to do menial tasks. The Devas fed up and unable to bear his torture and complained to Lord Shiva. As Lord Shiva’s third eye opened to create six sparks of fire emanated and gave rise to six babies. As the babies were clasped by Goddess Uma, they joined together, which gave birth to Lord Murugan, a god with six faces and twelve arms who was crafted to fulfill one purpose, get Surapadman’s head. An intense battle ensued, which was fought for a few days after Surapadman denied to release the devas. This resulted in Surapadman’s demise and the birth of Murugan’s signature vahana, the peacock. Lord Muruga desired to worship his father, Lord Shiva. Hence Mayan, the divine architect, constructed this shrine at Tiruchendur. Even now, Lord Subramaniyan is seen in the posture of worshiping Lord Shiva in the sanctum sanctorum. The Temple is said to be two thousand years old and has overcome the adversities of time.</p>
          <p>The Temple was captured by the Dutch East India company between the years 1646 to 1648, on course of their war with the Portuguese. The Dutch finally agreed to vacate the Temple on orders from the Naik ruler but not before they looted away the idols and took them along to Galle, Dutch Ceylon. The idols were finally returned after many negotiations with the ruler. This incident has many stories associated with it, to which even science doesn’t offer any explanation.</p>

            <h3>Kattabomman Fort</h3>
            <p><u><b>Story Behind this Temple</b></u></p>
            <p>In the verdant countryside of Thoothukudi, there is a place that holds within its walls the echoes of a bygone era. A place where legends were born and the spirit of independence burned bright. This place is none other than the Kattabomman Memorial Fort, situated in the serene village of Panchalankurichi.</p>
            <p>Stepping through the imposing gates of this ancient fort, you will be transported back in time to the 18th century, when the fearless Veerapandiya Kattabomman ruled over the land with a fiery passion for freedom. The fort, a testament to his valour, stands tall and proud, its mud and brick walls an architectural marvel that bears witness to the resilience of the human spirit.</p>
            <p>Rising above the surrounding landscape, the fort's towering walls and majestic watchtowers are a sight to behold, evoking images of a time when swords clashed and battle cries echoed through its halls. The fort was built to withstand the might of invading forces, and its sturdy walls and secret underground passages stand as a testament to Kattabomman's unwavering courage in the face of adversity.</p>
